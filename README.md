## Clone the Repository

To get a copy of this repository on your local machine, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
```

##Setup the Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using venv:

## 1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your_repository_name
```

## 2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

## 3. Activate the virtual environment:

- on Windows
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- on macOS/Linux
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

# Install Requirements
After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary packages using requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the Flask Application
```bash
python app.py
```
The application will start, and you can access it at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.

# Deployment on Azure
